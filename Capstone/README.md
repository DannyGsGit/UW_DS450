# Administrative

## To do list:
* Add garage area to lot coverage calculation
* Adjust house size by year built (ie newer homes tend to be larger)
* Bin years by architectural era
* Collapse porch features
* Flag luxury properties?
* Take out competition data formatting dependencies on model (use schema instead)

## Observations
* Disproportionate Old Town, Crawford, Edwards, and BrkSide neighborhood outliers
* A couple of new, large homes in Edwards neighborhood show extreme residuals
